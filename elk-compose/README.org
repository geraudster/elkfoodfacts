* Docker Compose for ELK stack

** Usage

Clone this repository, _cd_ into it, then:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose up
#+END_SRC

Try to open kibana UI: http://localhost:5601 (default credentials: elastic/changeme)

For logstash, put conf files in _pipeline_ directory, they will be
executed in alphabetical order. You can also put data files in _data_ directory.
Then you can stop/start logstash:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose stop logstash
docker-compose up logstash
#+END_SRC

** Troubleshoot

You may fall on the following error when starting ElasticSearch:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] likely too low, increase to at least [262144]
#+END_SRC

Just set the parameter accordingly: 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
#+END_SRC
